<p><font color="cream" size="5">Want to travel long routes, in quick time without spending much money? Go for Jan-Shatabdi! 
	These trains are best for frugal travelers who do not want to spend too much money on luxury. The Non-AC
	 chair car is very cheap on this train. Itcosts almost equal to the unreserved class in express/mail trains.
	For example, a comfortable train ticket from Mumbai to Goa covering a distance of 800 km will cost you 197 Rs ($4) on this train!
	Another benefit is that unlike the sleeper coach express trains there are almost always seats available.
	So you don't have to worry much about reservation!
